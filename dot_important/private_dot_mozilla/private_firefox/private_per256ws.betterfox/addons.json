Locking the front door won’t stop the most determined folks from getting inside, especially if you’ve left the back door and windows unlocked and an extra key under the doormat. That’s why we offer multiple types of privacy protection, most of which aren’t offered in most popular browsers by default.\n\nWith the press of a button, you get seamless protection from most 3rd-party trackers while you search and browse, access to tracking protections for emails you receive, and much more. Together these privacy essentials make more privacy your default.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS\n\n    Search Privately by Default — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in, so you can easily search the web without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Trackers Before They Load — automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using (e.g. sale, ads, etc.) any data from these trackers. Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes well above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default.\n    Automatically Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to automatically use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection, which helps shield your data from Wi-Fi snoopers and network onlookers like your Internet provider. Most popular browsers only direct users to encrypted versions of pages in specific circumstances, like when you navigate directly to a page in the address bar. We check our list of upgradable sites for all links you click.\n    Enable Built-in Email Protection — Over 85% of emails sent to Duck Addresses contained trackers that can detect when you’ve opened a message, where you were when you opened it, and what device you were using. Email Protection makes it easy to block most email trackers and hide your existing address when signing up for things online, all without switching email providers.\n    Escape Fingerprinting — help stop companies from creating a unique identifier for you by blocking their attempts to combine specific information about your browser and device settings.\n    Block Tracking Cookies— prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS NOT AVAILABLE ON MOST BROWSERS\n\n    Link Tracking Protection — helps stop companies from gathering your browsing history and other information via personal identifiers embedded in the links you click on.\n    Embedded Social Content Tracking Protection — blocks embedded Facebook content around the web so they can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired.\n    Google AMP Protection — forces sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with Global Privacy Control (GPC) — built-into our app, GPC intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nNote about our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection following DuckDuckGo ad clicks: Our 3rd-Party Tracker Protection goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default, but we’re constantly working to make it more comprehensive. Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.\n\nRead more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/privacy/web-tracking-protections/\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities with one app. It's privacy, simplified.\n\nAbout Us: https://duckduckgo.com/about/\nHow It Works: https://duckduckgo.com/app\nPrivacy Newsletter: https://duckduckgo.com/newsletter\nPrivacy Policy: https://duckduckgo.com/privacy/\nTerms of Service: https://duckduckgo.com/terms/\nOpen Source: https://github.com/duckduckgo/duckduckgo-privacy-extension","weeklyDownloads":7352,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"DuckDuckGo","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/3946396/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/283/283297.png?modified=1685690530","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/283/283297.jpg?modified=1685690530","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/283/283298.png?modified=1685690530","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/283/283298.jpg?modified=1685690530","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/283/283299.png?modified=1685690530","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/283/283299.jpg?modified=1685690530","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/283/283300.png?modified=1685690530","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/283/283300.jpg?modified=1685690530","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/283/283301.png?modified=1685690530","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/283/283301.jpg?modified=1685690530","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.358,"reviewCount":603,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox/reviews/","updateDate":1706882131000},{"id":"{446900e4-71c2-419f-a6a7-df9c091e268b}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/735/735894-32.png?modified=27707d93","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/735/735894-64.png?modified=27707d93","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/735/735894-128.png?modified=27707d93"},"name":"Bitwarden - Free Password Manager","version":"2024.2.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4233394/bitwarden_password_manager-2024.2.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://bitwarden.com","supportURL":"https://bitwarden.com","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/","description":"A secure and free password manager for all of your devices.","fullDescription":"Bitwarden, Inc. is the parent company of 8bit Solutions LLC.\n\nNAMED BEST PASSWORD MANAGER BY THE VERGE, U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT, CNET, AND MORE.\n\nManage, store, secure, and share unlimited passwords across unlimited devices from anywhere.

As you can see in WebExtensions API documentation or simplified tutorials, there's no way to apply any modifications to a web page without gaining the full access permission to that page. Stylus is mostly used to apply global themes, which is why it requests a global permission. In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":2900,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":394,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1622132703","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.jpg?modified=1622132703","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1622132705","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.jpg?modified=1622132705","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":377,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1622132709","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.jpg?modified=1622132709","thumbnailWidth":449,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1622132711","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.jpg?modified=1622132711","thumbnailWidth":353,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1622132713","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.jpg?modified=1622132713","thumbnailWidth":317,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6724,"reviewCount":314,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1707380293000},{"id":"myallychou@gmail.com","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2602/2602948-32.png?modified=07136808","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2602/2602948-64.png?modified=07136808","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2602/2602948-128.png?modified=07136808"},"name":"Unhook: Remove YouTube Recommended Videos Comments","version":"1.6.3","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4210197/youtube_recommended_videos-1.6.3.xpi","homepageURL":"https://unhook.app","supportURL":"https://unhook.app/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-recommended-videos/","description":"Hide YouTube related videos, comments, video suggestions wall, homepage recommendations, trending tab, and other distractions.","fullDescription":"Hide YouTube related videos, comments, video suggestions wall, homepage recommendations, trending tab, and other distractions.\n\nA browser extension to eliminate distractions on YouTube, including the recommended sidebar, endscreen video suggestions, user comments, homepage related videos feed, trending tab, turn off autoplay or annotations, and more.

Regular expressions support capturing parantheses so you could define the pattern: http://foo.com/bar.php\\?id=(\\d+) and define the redirect as http://bar.com/baz.php?id=$1. In that case http://foo.com/bar.php?id=1234 would automatically redirect to http://bar.com/baz.php?id=1234.

FoxFilter is a personal content filter that helps block pornographic and other inappropriate content.","fullDescription":"Protect your family from inappropriate content on the web. FoxFilter is an effective content filter that helps block pornographic and other inappropriate content.\n\nGetting Started\n\nOnce installed, right-click on any web page and select “FoxFilter Settings” to change the default settings to your preferences.\n\nRecent Reviews\n\nRecently called \"THE Parental control for Firefox!\"\n\n\"This is one of the best and most useful add-ons I've seen in a while. It is very effective and flexible. It's also easy to use. My hat’s off to the designer. This will be a great tool for keeping my young kids away from bad web sites.\"\n\n\"I have tried a few different filters for both Windows and Ubuntu and by far, this is the easiest to administer in a home environment. It's not free but $10 for a five computer license.. it's almost free and compared to the headache of managing Net Nanny or proxies like squid/Dans Gaurdian - it's a steal.. \"\n\n\"FoxFilter is still my favorite by far. OpenDNS offers a free version, but you have to put up with advertisements. Their 'deluxe' version is $9.95 per year, so that is not free.\"\n\n\"I have tried other filters and such out there, but this one is really easy to use and works really well. This one makes it easy to add sites on the fly to the list of ok’d sites plus I can temporarily turn off the filter while I'm using the computer. It will even turn the filter back on for me when I restart Firefox if I choose that option.\"\n\nReviewed by: CNET Staff on February 27, 2009\n\nInstead of a stand-alone program eating up your system resources, this free Firefox add-on can ensure that young users are safe from inappropriate content. With a few simple clicks, FoxFilter successfully blocks select content on the Web.\n\nFoxFilter can be accessed through your Preferences menu. The tabbed interface is very easy to read, and walks you through each security preference so that you don't miss a beat. The program comes preset with obvious keywords that would raise a red flag. You can edit the list and add your own keywords and Web sites. Likewise, you can add keywords that you want the program to ignore. Specific Web sites can be added to the list with ease. All of your settings can be password protected.\n\nFoxFilter performed exactly as promised and applied all of our security settings without any issues. You'll rest easy when young users are online with the protection this freeware offers. We recommend this simple, effective plug-in for all users.\n\nUser review on CNET: This is one strong filter. I was having trouble with filtering on firefix and came across this software. Now I don't worry about it. If you have computer savvy teens who have developed the habit of going to the wrong sites because they can...this is your software.\n\nDetails\n\nFoxFilter helps block content for essentially any user-defined Web site or criteria. You can quickly and easily block content for an entire site (e.g. Playboy) or enter custom keyword filters (e.g. videos, movies, images, pornography, nudity, gambling, explosives, etc.) that will be used to help block content for any site that contains these keywords. There are many pornography-related keywords already included (see Filter Keywords below for more info). FoxFilter is designed to work with Firefox on Mac, Linux and Windows and includes password-protected settings and security features to help prevent it from being bypassed, uninstalled or disabled. A password recovery feature is also available.\n\nThe FoxFilter Team has spent thousands of hours in development, maintenance and support of FoxFilter. We are very proud of our product and are very happy that is helping protect children, teens and adults from inappropriate content on the Internet. We're confident that you will agree that FoxFilter is the most simple and effective Firefox Add-on for helping filter inappropriate content.\n\nSensitivity\n\nIf FoxFilter seems too sensitive, please keep in mind that if \"Examine Body Content\" is selected in the \"Sensitivity Settings\", it can make filtering a bit sensitive, which is why this setting is turned off by default. You may encounter blocking of non-por*ographic sites, such as Yahoo.com, that contain \"fre e\" and \"s*x\" somewhere in the body content. You can either choose to not examine the Body content and just examine Meta content, Title and URL, or add URL exceptions as needed.\n\nFiltering Keywords\n\nPer Microsoft, the link below provides a list of keywords that are common in bulk, unsolicited, and adult e-mail. These same keywords can also be used as a starting point for Web site content filtering.\nhttp://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA010450051033.aspx\n\nAuthor Request\n\nPlease don't use Reviews and Discussions to post questions or report bugs. Otherwise, we have no way to respond. As a courtesy please give us a chance to answer your question or offer assistance before reporting a bug.\n\nUninstalling\n\nDeciding to uninstall? If so, we're sorry to see you go. FoxFilter has proven to be simple, effective and reliable and continues to offer all of its filtering features for free. As with any add-on/extension, you can easily remove it.\n\nKeywords: foxfilter, filter, block, blocker, content, adult content, video, videos, image, images, movie, movies, parent, parents, kid, kids, children, parental control, porn, pornography, porno, pornographic, block site, whitelist, white list, blacklist, black list, K9, procon, latte, adblock, library, libraries, school, schools, share, shared, organization, organizations, protect, protection, safe, safety, xxx","weeklyDownloads":133,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Inspired Effect","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/96375/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/192/192859.png?modified=1622132155","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/192/192859.jpg?modified=1622132155","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Blocked Websites and Content"},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/192/192860.png?modified=1622132155","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/192/192860.jpg?modified=1622132155","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"Customize your settings"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":3.7538,"reviewCount":24,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxfilter/reviews/","updateDate":1623012034000},{"id":"{b52acdad-e4a6-44da-afc9-9bd22572db99}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/758/758970-32.png?modified=1695798673","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/758/758970-64.png?modified=1695798673","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/758/758970-128.png?modified=1695798673"},"name":"Enforce SafeSearch","version":"6.4.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3896849/sas-6.4.0_RbzmPqF.xpi","homepageURL":null,"supportURL":"https://github.com/serv-inc/safe-search/wiki/","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sas/","description":"Toggles the built-in filter on Google, YouTube, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Ixquick, Startpage, Dogpile, Yandex, Vimeo, Reddit, Ecosia, Dailymotion, Qwant, Patreon, and Onesearch .","fullDescription":"Automatically toggles the built-in adult content filter (most often safe search) on Google, YouTube, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Ixquick, Startpage, Dogpile, Yandex, Vimeo, Reddit, Ecosia, Dailymotion, Qwant, Patreon, and Onesearch.","weeklyDownloads":34,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"serv-inc","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12057186/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/186/186836.png?modified=1622132642","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/186/186836.jpg?modified=1622132642","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"safe search on Google search"}],"contributionURL":"https://www.patreon.com/user?u=8253776&utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.1905,"reviewCount":16,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sas/reviews/","updateDate":1695981431000},{"id":"{17c4514d-71fa-4633-8c07-1fe0b354c885}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1483/1483656-32.png?modified=0b794223","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1483/1483656-64.png?modified=0b794223","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/1483/1483656-128.png?modified=0b794223"},"name":"Hide YouTube Thumbnails","version":"2.5.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4188243/hide_youtube_thumbnails-2.5.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/domdomegg/hideytthumbnails-extension","supportURL":"https://github.com/domdomegg/hideytthumbnails-extension","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-youtube-thumbnails/","description":"Hide YouTube Thumbnails for less clickbaity browsing","fullDescription":"Simply hides thumbnails on YouTube to have a more peaceful and less distracting browsing experience.
